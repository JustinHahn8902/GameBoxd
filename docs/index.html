            <h1>Introduction/Background</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>
            Our aim for Project 2 was to build a social cataloging platform, similar to Letterboxd, for video game enthusiasts, providing features such as game cataloging, 
            reviews, ratings, and creating/viewing lists. Furthermore, we also included the additive feature of AI-generated game descriptions, seeking to provide a
            more genuine and honest take on what each game offers.
            This platform seeks to bridge the gap between gamers and their desire to share experiences, discover new games, 
            and engage with a community that values thoughtful discussions and curation. By offering tools for users to write reviews, rate titles, 
            and craft personalized lists, the platform aspires to become a go-to destination for gaming enthusiasts to connect and explore.
          </p>
          <p>
            To achieve this, we employed a technology stack tailored for scalability, usability, and performance.
            The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, providing a robust and flexible API layer to handle user interactions and data storage. 
            For the database, we chose MongoDB, which allows for efficient handling of the semi-structured data typical in game metadata, user reviews, and ratings. 
            The frontend is built using React.js, delivering a responsive and interactive user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is significant because it addresses the lack of a centralized platform where gamers can both curate their personal game collections 
            and interact socially around shared interests. Existing platforms like Metacritic and IGN offer reviews and ratings but lack the personalized 
            cataloging and community-driven features central to our project. Our approach combines the best elements of social media and cataloging platforms, 
            providing a unique space for gamers to engage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scope of the project includes the development of core features like user registration/login, game search and cataloging, review and rating submission, 
            and the ability to create and share lists. We also plan to implement social features such as following other users and interacting with their reviews and lists.
            Our project management approach follows an Agile methodology, emphasizing iterative development, frequent user feedback, and adaptability to changing requirements.

        <div class="contentTitle">
          <h1>Design</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="contentText">

        <img src="login.PNG" alt="An example image" width="800">
        <p>
          The design of our application is centered around creating a user-friendly, visually engaging, and community-driven platform that enhances the gaming experience.
          Every design decision reflects our commitment to usability, scalability, and fostering connections amongst gamers. Let’s dive into the details of how the design achieves this.
          <img src="chart.PNG" alt="An example image" width="700" height="auto">
          Our system is meticulously designed using a React.js frontend, a Node.js/Express-powered backend, and a MongoDB database connected via the Mongoose Object Relational Mapper (ORM). 
          This architecture allows seamless communication between the frontend and backend through structured HTTP requests, enabling users to interact effortlessly with the system. Key features 
          such as the GameCard and StarRating components enhance the user experience by dynamically rendering relevant game information and user-generated ratings.

            <h1>Design Patterns Implementation</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <h2>Singleton Pattern</h2>
            <p>
                The singleton design pattern is used in many different segments of the backend for one primary reason: Providing a single instance of an object throughout the codebase that allows for global management of database state.
                It also provides marginal improvements in resource allocation and performance when compared to the alternative of opening and closing database conenctions in several different areas of the code.


            </p>
            <h3>Code Example 1 (<i>server/server.js:8</i>)</h3>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    // Connect to MongoDB
                    mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
                      useNewUrlParser: true,
                      useUnifiedTopology: true,
                    })
                      .then(() => {
                        console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
                        
                        // Create and start the Express app
                        const app = createApp();
                        app.listen(PORT, () => {
                          console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
                        });
                      })
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>The above code snippet shows our backend code making a single connection to our MongoDB database prior to instantiating the app. This connection is then used globally throughout the application via the Mongoose ORM library.</p>
            
            <h3>Code Example 2 (<i>server/models/Game.js</i>)</h3>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const mongoose = require('mongoose');

                    const gameSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
                        igdb_id: Number,
                        name: String,
                        genres: [String],
                        release_date: Date,
                        cover_url: String,
                        screenshot_urls: [String],
                        similar_games: [Number],
                        total_rating: Number,
                        total_rating_count: Number,
                        summary: String,
                        website_urls: [String],
                        platforms: [String]
                    });
                    
                    const Game = mongoose.model('Game', gameSchema);
                    
                    module.exports = Game;
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p>Code Example 2 shows the instantiation of a <i>Game</i> model object that it subsequently exported and used as a database access object throughout the codebase, exemplifying the usage of the singleton design pattern.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, the usage of the singleton pattern throughout the backend API code made interfacing with the database significantly easier by reducing the effort required to make database transactions.</p>
            <br>
          <h2>Factory Pattern</h2>
          <p>
              The factory pattern was also used in the process of simplifying database access in the backend code. By defining our data models using Mongoose schemas, we were able to completely abstract the logic required for interfacing with a variety of MongoDB collections.
              As seen in code example 2, using the factory pattern to instantiate models out of schema objects allowed us to centralize the creation logic for models making adjustments and additions to small fields in the MongoDB collections very simple. This pattern in tandem
              with the singleton pattern made the construction of the database structure as well as the interaction throughout execution very simple.
              <br>
              Additionally, the factory pattern was used in our script for loading game data from the external IGDB API into our Mongo collection. Below, code example 3 shows the implementation of a <i>fetchAndSaveIGDBData</i> function that acquires data from the API, and then based
              on the contents of the fetched data, creates game objects with a variety of attributes. Thus, this function is used to create objects without directly specifying the exact class or implementation details of the object being created.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Code example 3 (<i>server/scripts/loadFullIGDBData.js</i>)</h3>
          <pre>
              <code>
                  async function fetchAndSaveIGDBData() {
                    try {
                        const token = await getOAuthToken();
                        const games = await fetchGames(token, 500, 1000); // Adjust limit and offset as needed
                        console.log(`Fetched ${games.length} games`);
                
                        for (const game of games) {
                            console.log(`Processing Game: ${game.name}`);
                
                            const realGame = {
                                igdb_id: game.id,

          <h2>Decorator Pattern</h2>
          <p>Finally, the decorator pattern was also used to aid the database interaction process, specifically when a new user registers. By using Mongoose schemas <i>pre</i> function, 
            we were able to add additional functionality and middleware during the database object creation process. This decorator pattern was applied for two primary reasons:<br>
          </p>
          <h3>1) Password Hashing <i>server/models/user.js:38</i></h3>
          <pre>
              <code>
                  userSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
                      if (!this.isModified('password')) return next();
                      this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 10);
                      next();
                  });
              </code>
          </pre>
          <p>In order to securely store our users' data, it is imperative that passwords are adequetly encrypted via hashing prior to their insertion into the database. As such, we used a decorator function on our userSchema
            to call the BCrypt library's hash function on the password.
          </p>
          <h3>2) Creation of default attributes for users <i>server/models/user.js:44</i></h3>
          <pre>
              <code>
                  userSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {

                        const defaultLists = ['Played', 'Currently Playing', 'Want to Play'];
                        const lists = await Promise.all(defaultLists.map(async (name) => {
                            const list = new List({ name, user: this._id });
                            await list.save();
                            return list._id;
                        }));
                        this.lists = lists;
                    }

            <h2>Test Strategy</h2>
            <p>
                We implemented a testing strategy for GameBoxd that incorporated both blackbox and whitebox testing strategies.
                We employed Blackbox testing to validate external system behaviors this was done by not focusing on user inputs and expected outputs without delving into the internal code structure.
                Furthermore, with Whitebox testing, we targeted the internal logic and pathways to ensure all individual components and integrations of our applications were functioning as intended.
            </p>

            <h3>Blackbox Testing</h3>
            <p>
                With our Blackbox testing strategy we focused on validating the external functionalities of the system, including user registration, login, and user interaction features like searching for users or retrieving user details by ID.
                We conducted the testing process with Postman to simulate API requests and validate responses. These tests ensured that the system behaved as expected when interacting with external inputs under various scenarios.
                We applied our ai-generated tests using GPT-4 to generate and refine test cases for common scenarios and potential edge cases, while also manually creating test cases ensured comprehensive coverage of more nuanced conditions.

                For the registration functionality, we executed several test cases to ensure robust validation and error handling. The POST request to <code>/api/auth/register</code> with valid data successfully registered a new user, returning the 201 status code the message "User registered successfully."
                Another test case we created confirmed that attempting to register with an existing username resulted in a 400 status code and the error message "Username already exists."
                The other test cases validated the handling of incomplete input; for example, a registration request missing a username or password correctly returned a 400 status code with the message "Username and password are required."

                We tested Login functionality similarly with various scenarios.
                With our tests successful login with valid credentials returned a 200 status code and the message "Login successful."
                However, for our tests on login attempts with incomplete input, such as a missing username or password, result n a 400 status code with the error message "Username and password are required."
                Tests also covered invalid credentials: a non-existent username returned a 404 status code and the message "User not found," while an incorrect password produced a 401 status code and the message "Invalid password."

                Our search functionality, accessed via <code>/api/auth/search</code>, was tested for accuracy and proper error handling. A GET request with a valid query returned a list of matching users and a 200 status code, verifying the system's ability to filter user data effectively.
                Conversely, a missing query parameter appropriately returned a 400 status code and the message "Username is required."

                We also implemented tests for retrieving user details by ID validated the system’s ability to fetch data accurately.
                A GET request to <code>/api/auth/:id</code> with a valid user ID returned the expected user information and a 200 status code.
                In contrast, we created a test for invalid or non-existent user ID resulted in a 404 status code with the message "User not found."
                These test cases collectively ensured the reliability and robustness of the system's core functionalities by simulating real-world user interactions and validating appropriate system responses across various scenarios.
            </p>

            <h3>Whitebox Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Our white box testing pushed us towards the internal code and logic of the application, ensuring that each function and component behaved as intended.
                The testing process employed Jest for unit and integration testing, which validated individual API endpoints and the interaction between the backend and the MongoDB database.
                We used Github Copilot and GPT-4 to generate initial test scripts, providing a quick and structured foundation for test cases.
                However, manual refinement was necessary to enhance test coverage and address nuances not captured by the AI-generated cases.
                This method ensured that the internal workings of the application were robust and reliable.Whitebox testing focused on ensuring the correct execution of internal logic.
                For instance, a happy path test for the <code>/api/auth/register</code> endpoint verified that a user could be successfully registered and stored in the database when provided with valid inputs.
                The expected and actual results aligned, confirming the test as a pass. Another test case examined the behavior of the login endpoint when an incorrect password was submitted.
                The system returned a 401 status code and the message "Invalid password," meeting the expected result and passing the test.
                These tests highlighted the reliability of the internal logic under both expected and erroneous conditions.
            </p>


            <h2>AI Tools in Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Our white box testing focused on the internal code and logic of the application, ensuring that each function and component behaved as intended.
                This testing approach employed Jest for unit and integration testing, validating the functionality of API endpoints and their interactions with the MongoDB database.
                To streamline the initial development of test scripts, we used GitHub Copilot and GPT-4, which provided structured and efficient foundations for test cases.
                However, manual refinement was necessary to ensure comprehensive coverage and through these manual changes we addressed nuances not captured by the AI.
                We focused on White box testing by examining the <code>/api/auth/register</code> endpoint to validate the registration functionality.
                We also focused on the user story such that the "happy path" test confirmed that a new user could be registered and stored in the database when provided with valid inputs, returning a 201 status code and the message "User registered successfully."
                We handled edge cases, by creating a test for duplicate usernames ensured that attempted to register an already existing username returned a 400 status code and the error message "Username already exists."
                Additional tests verified that incomplete input, such as missing a username or password, appropriately returned a 400 status code with the error message "Username and password are required," ensuring consistent validation across different input scenarios.
                The <code>/api/auth/login</code> endpoint underwent rigorous testing to validate its functionality.
                We set up our successful login with valid credentials returned a 200 status code and the message "Login successful," which allowed us to confirm working login functionality.
                The edge cases we included incomplete handle the input scenarios where a missing username or password correctly returned a 400 status code with the message "Username and password are required."
                Our tests also validated error handling for invalid credentials: a non-existent username returned a 404 status code with the message "User not found," while an incorrect password resulted in a 401 status code and the message "Invalid password."
                These tests ensured robust validation and error handling for the login feature.
                The user search functionality, we implemented via the <code>/api/auth/search</code> endpoint, was tested for its ability to handle both valid and invalid queries.
                We increase valid search query returned a 200 status code and a list of matching users, confirming the functionality of the search feature. On the other hand, a missing query parameter resulted in a 400 status code with the error message "Username is required," validating the endpoint's ability to handle invalid input gracefully.
                We also tested for retrieving user details by ID through the <code>/api/auth/:id</code> endpoint verified the system’s ability to accurately fetch user data.
                A GET request with a valid user ID successfully returned the user’s details with a 200 status code, ensuring proper functionality. There is also the output that an output invalid or non-existent user ID correctly returned a 404 status code with the message "User not found," demonstrating reliable error handling for invalid inputs.
                The white box testing cases that we have created deeply test what we have implemented in the backend, ensuring that the internal logic and pathways are functioning as intended.
                By combining AI-generated test scripts with manual refinements, the testing process ensured a thorough and reliable evaluation of all core functionalities, highlighting the robustness and reliability of the system's internal structure.

            <h1>Comparative Analysis: AI vs Human Test Generation</h1>

            <h2>Performance Metrics</h2>
            <p>
                By using AI-assisted test generation we significantly reduced the time required to create test cases compared to human manual efforts.
                For instance, by our generation of a test case for "Register User (Valid Input)" took only 0.25 minutes with AI, while it took 12 minutes manually.
                Similar reductions were observed across all test scenarios, with AI-generated times consistently under 1 minute while human-generated times ranged from 8 to 15 minutes.
                This drastic reduction in time allowed for more iterations and faster development cycles.
            </p>

            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <p>
                When we were using AI tools like GPT-4o and GitHub Copilot provided structured and efficient templates for test cases. These tools streamlined the process,
                especially for repetitive or straightforward scenarios such as validating user input or error handling.
                However, when we needed to address nuanced edge cases and ensure comprehensive test coverage, particularly for scenarios involving complex business logic,
                we needed to jump in and manually refine the test cases. This manual refinement was essential to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the tests.
            </p>


            <h2>Impact on Quality</h2>
            <p>
                While AI-generated test cases were consistent and well-structured, they occasionally missed complex edge cases or required additional refinement to ensure correctness.
                Human-generated tests, specifically depending on whether the developer could address all aspects of the test that they were intending to address, provided more comprehensive coverage and addressed nuanced scenarios effectively. By combining AI-generated test cases with manual refinement, the team achieved a balance of speed and quality.

        </div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>Looking ahead, there are several enhancements and expansions planned for GameBoxd. One key direction is the
              development of enhanced social features, including direct messaging, collaborative list creation, and discussion
              forums. These additions aim to foster a more interactive community and encourage greater user engagement. Another
              priority is the creation of dedicated iOS and Android applications to improve accessibility and enhance the user
              experience on mobile devices. The integration of advanced AI capabilities is also planned, such as personalized
              game recommendations based on user preferences, playing history, and community trends. This feature would add
              significant value by tailoring content to individual users.</p>

            <p>To enrich the platform further, additional APIs or data sources could be integrated to provide more comprehensive
                game metadata, including developer interviews, behind-the-scenes content, and historical insights. Monetization
                opportunities could also be explored, such as offering premium subscriptions for ad-free experiences, exclusive
                content, or partnerships with game publishers for sponsored recommendations. Gamification elements like badges,
                leaderboards, and achievements could be introduced to incentivize user engagement and create a sense of community
                accomplishment.</p>
