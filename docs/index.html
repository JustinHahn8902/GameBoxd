          <p>
            Our aim for Project 2 was to build a social cataloging platform, similar to Letterboxd, for video game enthusiasts, providing features such as game cataloging, 
            reviews, ratings, and creating/viewing lists. Furthermore, we also included the additive feature of AI-generated game descriptions, seeking to provide a
            more genuine and honest take on what each game offers.
            This platform seeks to bridge the gap between gamers and their desire to share experiences, discover new games, 
            and engage with a community that values thoughtful discussions and curation. By offering tools for users to write reviews, rate titles, 
            and craft personalized lists, the platform aspires to become a go-to destination for gaming enthusiasts to connect and explore.
          </p>
          <p>
            To achieve this, we employed a technology stack tailored for scalability, usability, and performance.
            The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, providing a robust and flexible API layer to handle user interactions and data storage. 
            For the database, we chose MongoDB, which allows for efficient handling of the semi-structured data typical in game metadata, user reviews, and ratings. 
            The frontend is built using React.js, delivering a responsive and interactive user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is significant because it addresses the lack of a centralized platform where gamers can both curate their personal game collections 
            and interact socially around shared interests. Existing platforms like Metacritic and IGN offer reviews and ratings but lack the personalized 
            cataloging and community-driven features central to our project. Our approach combines the best elements of social media and cataloging platforms, 
            providing a unique space for gamers to engage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scope of the project includes the development of core features like user registration/login, game search and cataloging, review and rating submission, 
            and the ability to create and share lists. We also plan to implement social features such as following other users and interacting with their reviews and lists.
            Our project management approach follows an Agile methodology, emphasizing iterative development, frequent user feedback, and adaptability to changing requirements.

            aiming to replicate the core functionality of platforms like Letterboxd while introducing unique features tailored to video game enthusiasts.
            Our research into Letterboxd's success highlighted the importance of allowing users to catalog their collections, rate and review items,
            and create personalized lists. We sought to adapt this model for video games, focusing on features like game cataloging and custom lists
            that reflect gamers' specific needs. However, we also recognized an opportunity to go beyond simple cataloging by leveraging AI-generated descriptions
            to enhance discovery.
            The AI-generated descriptions were prioritized because they provide suggestive, marketing-free insights into why a game might be enjoyable,
            helping users not only catalog games they already know but also discover new titles that align with their interests.
            By offering genuine information about gameplay, story, and mechanics, this feature bridges the gap between exploration and organization,
            setting our platform apart from existing solutions.

          <h2>Singleton Pattern</h2>
            <p>
                The singleton design pattern is used in many different segments of the backend for one primary reason: Providing a single instance of an object throughout the codebase that allows for global management of database state.
                It also provides marginal improvements in resource allocation and performance when compared to the alternative of opening and closing database conenctions in several different areas of the code.


            </p>
            <h3>Code Example 1 (<i>server/server.js:8</i>)</h3>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    // Connect to MongoDB
                    mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
                      useNewUrlParser: true,
                      useUnifiedTopology: true,
                    })
                      .then(() => {
                        console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
                        
                        // Create and start the Express app
                        const app = createApp();
                        app.listen(PORT, () => {
                          console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
                        });
                      })
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>The above code snippet shows our backend code making a single connection to our MongoDB database prior to instantiating the app. This connection is then used globally throughout the application via the Mongoose ORM library.</p>
            
            <h3>Code Example 2 (<i>server/models/Game.js</i>)</h3>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const mongoose = require('mongoose');

                    const gameSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
                        igdb_id: Number,
                        name: String,
                        genres: [String],
                        release_date: Date,
                        cover_url: String,
                        screenshot_urls: [String],
                        similar_games: [Number],
                        total_rating: Number,
                        total_rating_count: Number,
                        summary: String,
                        website_urls: [String],
                        platforms: [String]
                    });
                    
                    const Game = mongoose.model('Game', gameSchema);
                    
                    module.exports = Game;
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p>Code Example 2 shows the instantiation of a <i>Game</i> model object that it subsequently exported and used as a database access object throughout the codebase, exemplifying the usage of the singleton design pattern.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, the usage of the singleton pattern throughout the backend API code made interfacing with the database significantly easier by reducing the effort required to make database transactions.</p>
            <br>
          <h2>Factory Pattern</h2>
          <p>
              The factory pattern was also used in the process of simplifying database access in the backend code. By defining our data models using Mongoose schemas, we were able to completely abstract the logic required for interfacing with a variety of MongoDB collections.
              As seen in code example 2, using the factory pattern to instantiate models out of schema objects allowed us to centralize the creation logic for models making adjustments and additions to small fields in the MongoDB collections very simple. This pattern in tandem
              with the singleton pattern made the construction of the database structure as well as the interaction throughout execution very simple.
              <br>
              Additionally, the factory pattern was used in our script for loading game data from the external IGDB API into our Mongo collection. Below, code example 3 shows the implementation of a <i>fetchAndSaveIGDBData</i> function that acquires data from the API, and then based
              on the contents of the fetched data, creates game objects with a variety of attributes. Thus, this function is used to create objects without directly specifying the exact class or implementation details of the object being created.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Code example 3 (<i>server/scripts/loadFullIGDBData.js</i>)</h3>
          <pre>
              <code>
                  async function fetchAndSaveIGDBData() {
                    try {
                        const token = await getOAuthToken();
                        const games = await fetchGames(token, 500, 1000); // Adjust limit and offset as needed
                        console.log(`Fetched ${games.length} games`);
                
                        for (const game of games) {
                            console.log(`Processing Game: ${game.name}`);
                
                            const realGame = {
                                igdb_id: game.id,
                                name: game.name,
                                release_date: game.first_release_date ? new Date(game.first_release_date * 1000) : null,
                                genres: game.genres.map((genre) => genre.name),
                                cover_url: game.cover ? game.cover.url : null,
                                screenshot_urls: game.screenshots.map((screenshot) => screenshot.url),
                                similar_games: game.similar_games,
                                total_rating: game.total_rating,
                                total_rating_count: game.total_rating_count,
                                summary: game.summary,
                                website_urls: game.websites.map((website) => website.url),
                                platforms: game.platforms.map((platform) => platform.name),
                            };
                
                            await Game.create(realGame);
                        }
                    }
                }
              </code>
          </pre>
          <h2>Decorator Pattern</h2>
          <p>Finally, the decorator pattern was also used to aid the database interaction process, specifically when a new user registers. By using Mongoose schemas <i>pre</i> function, 
            we were able to add additional functionality and middleware during the database object creation process. This decorator pattern was applied for two primary reasons:<br>
          </p>
          <h3>1) Password Hashing <i>server/models/user.js:38</i></h3>
          <pre>
              <code>
                  userSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
                      if (!this.isModified('password')) return next();
                      this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 10);
                      next();
                  });
              </code>
          </pre>
          <p>In order to securely store our users' data, it is imperative that passwords are adequetly encrypted via hashing prior to their insertion into the database. As such, we used a decorator function on our userSchema
            to call the BCrypt library's hash function on the password.
          </p>
          <h3>2) Creation of default attributes for users <i>server/models/user.js:44</i></h3>
          <pre>
              <code>
                  userSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
                    if (this.isNew) {
                        const defaultLists = ['Played', 'Currently Playing', 'Want to Play'];
                        const lists = await Promise.all(defaultLists.map(async (name) => {
                            const list = new List({ name, user: this._id });
                            await list.save();
                            return list._id;
                        }));
                        this.lists = lists;
                    }
                    next();
                })
              </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
              We also used the same function on the userSchema in order to create 3 default "list" objects for users- "Played", "Currently Playing", and "Want to Play". Using the decorator pattern here made it very simple to modify and append data to objects
              prior to their insertion into the database.
